# 🏠 HBnB - My Holberton Project

> **Status**: 🚧 **Under Development** 🚧

## 📋 What I'm Building

I'm developing HBnB, a "bed and breakfast" style accommodation rental application as part of my Holberton School curriculum. The goal is to create a complete platform for managing accommodations, reservations, and users.

## 🎯 My Objectives

This project allows me to develop a complete web application following best practices:

- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data
- **REST API**: Standardized programming interface
- **UML Modeling**: Complete technical documentation with diagrams
- **Design Patterns**: Using patterns like Repository, Facade, etc.

## 🏗️ Architecture I Designed

I opted for a well-defined layered architecture:

```
📁 HBnB Application
├── 🌐 Presentation Layer (REST API)
├── 🧠 Business Logic Layer (Domain)
├── 💾 Data Access Layer (Repository)
└── 🗄️ Persistence Layer (Database)
```

## 🚀 Features I'm Going to Implement

### 👥 User Management
- Registration and authentication
- User profiles (hosts and travelers)
- Rights and permissions management

### 🏡 Accommodation Management
- Creation and modification of listings
- Availability management
- Photo upload and management
- Geolocation

### 📅 Reservation System
- Accommodation search
- Online booking
- Calendar management
- Payment system

### ⭐ Review System
- Reviews and ratings
- Bidirectional comments
- Content moderation

## 📊 Current Phase - Part 1: Design and Modeling

### ✅ What I've Already Accomplished

1. **Complete Technical Documentation**
   - Detailed architecture document
   - Functional requirements analysis

2. **UML Diagrams**
   - High-level package diagram
   - Business Logic class diagram
   - API call sequence diagrams

3. **Flow Modeling**
   - User interaction flows
   - Accommodation management flows
   - Review system flows
   - List request flows

### 🔄 My Next Steps

- [ ] **Part 2**: Business Logic layer implementation
- [ ] **Part 3**: REST API development
- [ ] **Part 4**: Web user interface
- [ ] **Part 5**: Testing and deployment

## 📚 Documentation
